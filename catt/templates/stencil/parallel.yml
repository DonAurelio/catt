    Linealized matrix template with stencil parallel programming pattern.
    support OpenMP loop coarse grain parallelization and OpenACC fine
    grain parallelization. 
functs:
    all: # Defines the functions available in the template
        - main
        - initialize
        - function

        - evolve
    editable: # Defines just the functions that can be modified by the user
        - initialize
        - function
    parallel: # Defines just the functions that are paralleizable and hoy to parallelize them
